# Music Releases

During this week's project we did a new album and single releases app. We used React components to build it.

## The problem

When we started this project we started to fetch the data by importing the data to each component. Later we learned how to only import the data into the first compontent and then use props to send the data to the rest of the compontents.

We also learned what the use of the "key" is. We had a lot of problem with naming unique key names, but we learned how to naming them correctly and also where we need to add them.
